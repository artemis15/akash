    Types of injectable objects and components
    <ul>
        <li>Values</li>
        <li>Factory</li>
        <li>Services</li>
        <li>Providers</li>
        <li>Constant</li>
    </ul>
    These core types can be injected into each other using AngularJS dependency injection mechanism.
  <hr/>
    <h4>Value injection</h4>
    <div ng-controller="valueCtrl">
        Check Value in console when this div (valueCtrl) is triggered
    </div>
  <hr/>
    <h4>Factory Method</h4>
    Factory is a function that creates values. When a service, controller etc. needs a value injected from a factory, the factory creates the value on demand. Once created, the value is reused for all services, controllers etc. which need it injected. Thus, a factory differs from a value in that it can use a factory function to create the object it returns. You can also inject values into a factory for use when creating the object. You cannot do that with a value.<br/>
<br/><div ng-controller="factCtrl">
    Check Value in console when this div (factCtrl) is triggered
</div><br/>
    <div ng-controller="factCtrl2">
        Check Value in console when this div (factCtrl2) is triggered i.e. injecting values into a factory
    </div>

<hr/>
<h5>Service Injection</h5>
    A service in AngularJS is a singleton JavaScript object which contains a set of functions. The functions contain whatever logic is necessary for the service to carry out its work.AngularJS services are created using the service() function on a module.
<div ng-controller="serviceCtrl">
    Check Value in console when this div (serviceCtrl) is triggered
</div>
    <div ng-controller="serviceCtrl2">
        Check Value in console when this div (serviceCtrl2) is triggered i.e. injecting values into a service
    </div>

    <hr/>
    <h5>Providers</h5>
    Providers in AngularJS is the most flexible form of factory you can create. You register a provider with a module just like you do with a service or factory, except you use the provider() function instead.
<br/>
<div ng-controller="providerCtrl">
    provider with click
    <button ng-click="whenBtnClicked()">Click Me!</button>
</div>
</body>
